    "__1.Descriptive Statistics :-__ Descriptive statistics involves the collection, analysis, and presentation of data in a way that describes and summarizes the main features of a dataset. It is used to provide a summary of a dataset, and it includes measures such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (standard deviation, variance), and graphical displays (histograms, box plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ A survey conducted to determine the average salary of employees in a company. The survey may include a calculation of the mean, median, and mode salaries, as well as measures of variability such as the standard deviation or variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2.Inferential Statistics :-__ Inferential statistics involves using a sample of data to make inferences about a larger population. It involves estimating population parameters based on sample statistics and testing hypotheses about the relationship between variables. Inferential statistics helps to make predictions about future events based on the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ A company wants to determine whether a new product is likely to be successful or not. A sample of potential customers could be selected and asked to try the product. The data collected could then be analyzed using inferential statistics to make predictions about the likely success of the product when it is launched to a larger population."

It is also used as a reference point to compare other measures of central tendency.\n",

The mode can also be used as a measure of central tendency when the data is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4.Range:__ The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of numbers. It gives an indication of how spread out the data is. The range is useful for understanding the spread of the data, but it can be heavily influenced by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__5.Variance:__ The variance is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. A high variance indicates that the data is spread out, while a low variance indicates that the data is tightly clustered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "__6.Standard Deviation:__ The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It gives an indication of how much the data deviates from the mean. A high standard deviation indicates that the data is spread out, while a low standard deviation indicates that the data is tightly clustered around the mean."
