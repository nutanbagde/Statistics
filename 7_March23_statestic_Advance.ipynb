    "Similarly, outliers can affect measures of dispersion, such as the range and standard deviation. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset, while the standard deviation measures the average distance of each data point from the mean. If there is an outlier with a very high or low value, the range will be increased, while the standard deviation will also be increased because the data points are more spread out from the mean."
