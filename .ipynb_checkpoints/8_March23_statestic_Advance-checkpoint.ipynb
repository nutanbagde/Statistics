    "Binomial distribution and Poisson distribution are both probability distributions that are commonly used in statistics and probability theory, but they are different in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition and application: The binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure) with a fixed probability of success. The Poisson distribution, on the other hand, is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed time or space interval, where the events occur randomly and independently with a fixed average rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of possible outcomes: In the binomial distribution, there are a fixed number of trials with only two possible outcomes for each trial. In the Poisson distribution, the number of possible outcomes is infinite, as the number of events that can occur in a given time or space interval is not limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: The binomial distribution has two parameters: the number of trials n and the probability of success p. The Poisson distribution has one parameter: the average rate of occurrence λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability mass function: The probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable representing the number of successes, k is the number of successes, n is the total number of trials, p is the probability of success in each trial, and (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient. The PMF of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=k) = (λ^k / k!) * e^(-λ)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable representing the number of events, k is the number of events, λ is the average rate of occurrence, e is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828, and k! is the factorial of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: The binomial distribution assumes that the trials are independent, and that the probability of success is constant for all trials. The Poisson distribution assumes that the events occur randomly and independently, and that the rate of occurrence is constant over time or space."
